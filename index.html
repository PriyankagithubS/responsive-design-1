            <h4 class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">What is networking?</h4>
            <p>Networking is the practice of connecting computers and other devices to share resources, such as data, files, and internet connections. This interconnected system of devices, known as a network, allows for communication and collaboration between different users and devices.</p>
            <h5>Purpose of Networking</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Communication: Networks allow devices to communicate with each other, whether they are in the same room or across the globe.</li>
                <li>Resource Sharing: Users can share files, printers, internet access, and other resources seamlessly.</li>
                <li>Collaboration: Networking enables collaboration among users, making it easier to work together on projects.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Components of a Network</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Nodes: These are the devices connected in a network, such as computers, servers, routers, switches, and smartphones.</li>
                <li>Cables and Signals: Networks use physical cables (like Ethernet or fiber optics) or wireless signals (like Wi-Fi) to transmit data between nodes.</li>
                <li>Protocols: Networks follow communication rules called protocols. These define how data is sent and received.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Types of networks</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Local Area Network (LAN): A LAN covers a small geographical area (like an office or home). Devices within a LAN can communicate directly.</li>
                <li>Wide Area Network (WAN): A WAN spans larger distances (across cities or countries). The internet is a global WAN.</li>
                <li>Wireless Networks: Wi-Fi networks allow wireless communication between devices.</li>
                <li>Virtual Private Networks (VPNs): Securely connect remote users or offices to a private network over the internet.</li>
            </ul>
            <h5>Networking Devices</h5>
            <ul>
                <li>Router: Connects different networks (e.g., your home network to the internet).</li>
                <li>Switch: Forwards data within a local network (LAN).</li>
                <li>Firewall: Protects networks by filtering incoming and outgoing traffic.</li>
                <li>Access Point (AP): Enables Wi-Fi connectivity.</li>
                <li>Modem: Converts digital data to analog signals for transmission over phone lines or cable systems.</li>
            </ul>

        <h3 class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">Basics</h3>
        <h5>Router</h5>
        <p>A router is a critical device that connects different networks together. Here’s what you need to know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function: Routers direct data traffic between networks. They determine the best path for data packets to reach their destination.</li>
            <li>Home Use: In homes, routers connect local devices (computers, smartphones, smart TVs) to the internet via an Internet Service Provider (ISP).</li>
            <li>Office Use: In offices, routers connect the local area network (LAN) to the wide area network (WAN), allowing communication with external networks.</li>
            <li>IP Address Assignment: Routers assign IP addresses to devices on the network.</li>
            <li>Security: Routers often include firewall features to protect against unauthorized access.</li>
            <li>Wireless Routers: Many routers also provide Wi-Fi functionality.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Switch</h5>
        <p>A switch operates within a single network (usually a LAN). Here’s what you should know:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function: Switches forward data packets based on MAC addresses. When a device sends data, the switch determines which port to send it to.</li>
            <li>Broadcast Domains: Each port on a switch creates a separate broadcast domain, reducing network congestion.</li>
            <li>Managed vs. Unmanaged: Managed switches allow network administrators to configure settings, while unmanaged switches operate with default settings.</li>
            <li>Layer 2 Device: Switches operate at the data link layer (Layer 2) of the OSI model.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Modem</h5>
        <p>A modem (short for modulator-demodulator) is essential for connecting your home network to the internet:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function: Modems convert digital data from your devices into analog signals (and vice versa) for transmission over phone lines or cable systems.</li>
            <li>Types: DSL modems (for digital subscriber lines), cable modems (for cable internet), and fiber-optic modems.</li>
            <li>ISP Connection: Modems connect to your ISP, allowing access to the internet.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Access Point</h5>
        <p>An access point provides wireless connectivity within a wired network:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function: APs allow Wi-Fi-enabled devices (laptops, smartphones, tablets) to connect to the LAN.</li>
            <li>Placement: APs are strategically placed to ensure good coverage and signal strength.</li>
            <li>SSID: Each AP has a unique Service Set Identifier (SSID) that identifies the wireless network.</li>
            <li>Security: APs can be secured using encryption (e.g., WPA2) and authentication methods.</li>
        </ul>
        <h5>Network Interface card</h5>
        <p>A NIC is a hardware component that enables devices (such as computers or servers) to connect to a network:</p>
        <ul>
            <li>Function: NICs provide the physical interface between the device and the network medium (cables or wireless signals).</li>
            <li>Built-In or External: Some devices have built-in NICs, while others require external NICs (e.g., USB or PCIe cards).</li>
            <li>MAC Address: Each NIC has a unique MAC address for identifying the device on the network.</li>
        </ul>

            <h3 class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">Topologies</h3>
          <h5>Bus Topology</h5>
          <p>All devices are connected to a single central cable, or bus. It is simple but can be slow and difficult to troubleshoot.</p>
          <h5>Star Topology</h5>
          <p>All devices are connected to a central hub or switch. It is more reliable and easier to manage.</p>
          <h5>Ring Topology</h5>
          <p>Devices are connected in a circular fashion. Data travels in one direction, reducing the chance of collision.</p>
          <h5>Mesh Topology</h5>
          <p>Every device is connected to every other device. It provides high redundancy and reliability.</p>

    <section id="pro">
     <div class="pro">
        <h3 class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">Networking Protocols</h3>
        <h5>TCP/IP (Transmission Control Protocol/Internet Protocol)</h5>
        <p>TCP/IP is the foundational protocol suite for the internet. TCP handles data transmission, ensuring packets are sent and received in order, while IP handles addressing and routing.</p>
        <h5>HTTP/HTTPS (Hypertext Transfer Protocol/Secure)</h5>
        <p>HTTP is used for transmitting web pages over the internet. HTTPS adds a layer of security with SSL/TLS encryption.</p>
        <h5>FTP (File Transfer Protocol)</h5>
        <p>FTP is used for transferring files between computers on a network.
        </p>
        <h5>SMTP/IMAP/POP3 (Simple Mail Transfer Protocol/Internet Message Access Protocol/Post Office Protocol)</h5>
        <p>These protocols are used for sending, receiving, and storing emails.</p>
        <h5>DNS (Domain Name System)</h5>
        <p>DNS translates domain names (like www.example.com) into IP addresses that computers can understand.</p>

            <h3 class="fst-italic text-decoration-underline">Advanced Topics</h3>
        <h5> Network Security</h5>
        <p>Implement security measures such as firewalls, encryption (WPA3 for Wi-Fi), and regular software updates to protect your network from unauthorized access and cyber threats.</p>
        </div>
        <h5> Virtual Private Network (VPN)</h5>
        <p>A VPN encrypts your internet connection, providing privacy and security, especially when using public Wi-Fi networks.</p>
